      <p>I liken coding to cooking. There are a lot of recipes out there and the real skill in cooking comes from trying out the recipes and blending the best parts to make your favorite dishes even better. I have a solid foundation in coding and can take my solutions and make them work for your needs. Look through this menu to see what I can bring to the table.</p>
